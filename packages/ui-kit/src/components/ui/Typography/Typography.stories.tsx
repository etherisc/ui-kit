      <TypographyP>
        Design systems are the foundation of modern user interface development.
        They provide a shared language between designers and developers,
        ensuring consistency across products and teams.
      </TypographyP>

      <TypographyH2>What Makes Typography Important?</TypographyH2>

      <TypographyP>
        Typography is more than just choosing fonts. It's about creating
        hierarchy, establishing rhythm, and guiding users through content. Good
        typography should be:
      </TypographyP>

      <TypographyList>
        <li>
          <strong>Readable</strong> - Easy to read at various sizes
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Accessible</strong> - Works for users with different abilities
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Consistent</strong> - Follows predictable patterns
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Scalable</strong> - Adapts to different screen sizes
        </li>
      </TypographyList>

      <TypographyH3>Implementation Best Practices</TypographyH3>

      <TypographyP>
        When implementing typography in your design system, consider using
        semantic HTML elements. For example, use{" "}
        <TypographyInlineCode>h1</TypographyInlineCode> for your main page
        title,
        <TypographyInlineCode>h2</TypographyInlineCode> for section headings,
        and so on.
      </TypographyP>

      <TypographyBlockquote>
        "Typography is the craft of endowing human language with a durable
        visual form."
        <footer className="mt-2">â€” Robert Bringhurst</footer>
      </TypographyBlockquote>

      <TypographyH3>Code Example</TypographyH3>

      <div className="p-4 bg-muted rounded-lg font-mono text-sm">
        <div>import {"{ Typography }"} from '@etherisc/ui-kit';</div>
        <div className="mt-2">&lt;Typography variant="h1"&gt;</div>
        <div className="ml-4">Welcome to Our Platform</div>
        <div>&lt;/Typography&gt;</div>
      </div>

      <TypographyP>
        This approach ensures that your content is both semantically meaningful
        and visually appealing, providing the best experience for all users.
      </TypographyP>
    </article>
