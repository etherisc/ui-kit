# Cursor Rule File â€“ React, React Router, Vite

## React hooks
- No unnamed `useEffect`; always clean up side-effects.
- Derive state during render; minimal `useState`.
- Memoize expensive calculations with `useMemo`.

## React Router v7
- Use data loaders + action where appropriate.
- Nested routes expressed via outlet; avoid prop-drilling of params.

## Vite
- Use plugin-react; no CRA config leftovers.
- Aliases defined in vite.config; avoid deep relative imports.
- Entry HTML kept minimal; inject script via Vite.
