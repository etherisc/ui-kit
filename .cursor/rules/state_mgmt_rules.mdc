# Cursor Rule File â€“ State Management

- **Local UI state:** `useState`, `useReducer` only; no derived data in state.
- **Global session:** Zustand store; strictly side-effect-free actions.
- **Remote data:** TanStack Query; disable refetchOnWindowFocus if not needed.
- No direct fetch in components; use query hooks.
- Forms handled by React Hook Form + Zod; no uncontrolled input hacks.
- ESLint custom rule enforces named effects & cleanup.
