# Cursor Rule File â€“ Git / GitFlow

## General
- **Never push with --no-verify** - hooks must always pass
- **Never push --force** - if needed, ask for explicit approval by user
- **For administrative operations**: Use proper git commands that don't trigger hooks:
  - Delete remote branches: Use GitHub CLI `gh api --method DELETE /repos/:owner/:repo/git/refs/heads/branch-name`
  - Or delete via GitHub web interface
  - Avoid git push operations for administrative tasks when possible
  - If in doubt, **always asks the user** what to do.

## Branching & commits
- **Follow GitFlow:** main, develop, feature/*, release/*, hotfix/*.
- **No direct commits to main or develop.**. Instead, create PRs.
- **Commits must follow Conventional Commits** (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`...).
- Always rebase feature branch onto latest develop before PR.

## Pull requests
- PR title = Conventional Commit summarising change scope.
- PR description must reference task ID & DoD.
- Require green CI (lint, tests, build) before merge.

## Versioning & tags
- Use Changesets for semver; no manual version bumps.
- Git tags auto-generated by CI (`vX.Y.Z`).

## Changelogs
- Changesets summary required in PR.
- Do not edit CHANGELOG manually.
