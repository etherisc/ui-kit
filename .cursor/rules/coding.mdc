# General Coding rules

- Before each step, pull/fetch the repo from remote.
- Default branch is "develop".
- Always follow the instructions in .cursor/rules
- Make sure you understand docs/planning.md and docs/project_plan.md
- Before starting coding, always present a plan for approval.
- Tasks are in docs/project_plan.md
- Each task will be implemented via a feature branch and a PR to the develop branch.

# Recipe for implementing tasks
Always follow the following recipe for implementing tasks: 
1. Only start implementing a task after the user has explicitly told so.
2. Before starting coding, create a task planning document (.md) in the docs/task-planning folder.
3. The task planning document contains a table with three columns: tasks description, DoD (Definition of Done) and Status. Status is open, working, checking, review, complete. Initially all tasks are "open".
   1. Open = the task hasn't been worked on.
   2. Working = the task is currently being implemented.
   3. Checking = the DoD of the tasks are being checked.
   4. Review = the user is reviewing the result.
   5. complete = the user has approved the result and the task is complete.
4. After creating the task planning document, let the user review the doc.
5. After the user has approved the task planning document, implement each task one after the other.
6. After implementing a task, check the criteria for DoD and report the result to the user.
7. If DoD is not met, fix the problem until DoD is met.
8. Before and after each task, update each task in the table with the right status.
9.  After finishing implementing, perform all necessary tests and check if the DoD for this task is met.
10. Report on test results and DoD criteria and ask user if a PR should be submitted.
11. If the user approves submitting a PR, and before PR is submitted, the task is marked with "PR" in docs/project_plan.md. 
12. After PR ist submitted, report to the user and wait for manual instructions.
13. The user will then review and merge the PR or ask for updates.
14. Pull the repo again to check if the PR has been merged. 
15. After task is completed (PR merged), the task is marked with a checkmark in docs/project_plan.md. This change does not warrant a separate PR, it will be included in the next PR. Just do git add for the file.
   
# Instructions to handle error situations:
- CI Pipeline fails:
  1. List the last github actions and find out which actions failed.
  2. Fetch the git actions log with `gh run view --log | cat`
  3. Analyze the log and make a proposal how to fix it.
  4. Let the user review / update the proposal, then execute the reviewed/updated proposal.
- Linter errors:
  1. Run `pnpm run lint`
  2. Find the linter errors
  3. Fix
