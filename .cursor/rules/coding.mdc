# General Coding rules

- Before each step, pull/fetch the repo from remote.
- Default branch is "develop".
- Always follow the instructions in .cursor/rules
- Make sure you understand docs/planning.md and docs/project_plan.md
- Before starting coding, always present a plan for approval.
- Tasks are in docs/project_plan.md
- Each task will be implemented via a feature branch and a PR to the develop branch.
- Always follow the following recipe for implementing tasks: 
  1. Start implementing after the user has explicitly told so.
  2. After finishing implementing, perform all necessary tests and check if the DoD for this task is met.
  3. Report on test results and DoD criteria and ask user if a PR should be submitted.
  4. If the user approves submitting a PR, and before PR is submitted, the task is marked with "PR" in docs/project_plan.md. 
  5. After PR ist submitted, report to the user and wait for manual instructions.
  6. The user will then review and merge the PR or ask for updates.
  7. Pull the repo again to check if the PR has been merged. 
  8. After task is completed (PR merged), the task is marked with a checkmark in docs/project_plan.md
