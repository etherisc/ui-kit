## Implementation Details

### 1. Toast System Design

We have implemented a Toast system using React Context for global state management:

1. Created `ToastProvider` component that:

   - Maintains state of active toasts
   - Provides methods to add/remove toasts
   - Handles auto-dismissal timing

2. Created `useToast` hook that provides:

   - `toast()` function for showing toasts
   - Support for different variants (success, error, warning, info)
   - Options for customizing duration, actions, etc.

3. Created `Toast` component for rendering individual toasts with:
   - Appropriate styling based on variant
   - Accessibility attributes
   - Close button

### 2. StatusBadge Design

The StatusBadge component:

- Displays status information using color coding and optional text
- Supports various status types (success, error, warning, pending, etc.)
- Is accessible with appropriate color contrast and aria attributes
- Follows the UI-Kit's design system

## Folder Structure

```
packages/ui-kit/src/
  components/
    feedback/               # New directory for feedback components
      Toast/
        index.ts           # Re-export
        Toast.tsx          # Component implementation
        Toast.stories.tsx  # Storybook documentation
        Toast.test.tsx     # Component tests
      StatusBadge/
        index.ts
        StatusBadge.tsx
        StatusBadge.stories.tsx
        StatusBadge.test.tsx
  providers/
    ToastProvider/
      index.ts
      ToastProvider.tsx
      ToastProvider.test.tsx
  hooks/
    useToast.ts           # Custom hook for accessing toast functionality
```

## Test Results

✅ All unit tests passing
✅ Build successful  
✅ Components exported correctly
✅ Accessibility tests passing (after fixing button contrast issues)
✅ Storybook stories working

## Definition of Done Verification

The original DoD was: "Vitest renders Toast, axe-core passes."

✅ **Vitest renders Toast**: All tests pass, including rendering tests for both Toast and StatusBadge components
✅ **axe-core passes**: Accessibility tests pass without violations

All tasks have been completed successfully and the implementation meets the requirements outlined in the project plan.
