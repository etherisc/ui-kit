# Task 2.2 Planning: React Hook Form + Zod Integration

## Overview

This task involves integrating React Hook Form (RHF) and Zod validation into the UI Kit, along with creating layout components for forms: FormGrid and FormGroup. These components will provide a foundation for building complex forms with validation in the UI Kit.

## Implementation Strategy

### Component Architecture

- Create a `form` directory under `src/components` for form-specific components
- Implement `useForm` wrapper hook around React Hook Form
- Create Field wrapper components for each form input component
- Use Zod schemas for validation
- Implement layout components (FormGrid, FormGroup) for structuring forms

### Testing Approach

- Unit tests with Vitest for functionality
- Test validation error reporting
- Test form submission behavior
- Create interactive Storybook example with form submission and validation

## Integration with Existing Components

- Existing form components (TextInput, NumberInput, etc.) will be wrapped with RHF field components
- These field wrappers will handle the connection between RHF and the UI components
- Layout components will provide consistent spacing and alignment

## Form Validation Strategy

- Use Zod for schema definition and validation
- Display validation errors inline with form fields
- Support both synchronous and asynchronous validation
- Support field-level and form-level validation
