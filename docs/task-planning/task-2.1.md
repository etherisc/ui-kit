# Task 2.1 Planning - Form Primitives

## Overview

Task 2.1 involves completing the implementation of core form components (NumberInput, Select, Checkbox, RadioGroup) which already have base implementations but require tests and integration into a form story.

## Tasks

| Task Description                              | DoD (Definition of Done)                                                                                   | Status   |
| --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| Create unit tests for NumberInput component   | Tests verify component renders correctly with all prop variations (label, description, error states, etc.) | Complete |
| Create unit tests for Select component        | Tests verify component renders correctly with all prop variations and options are displayed correctly      | Complete |
| Create unit tests for Checkbox component      | Tests verify component renders correctly with all prop variations and state changes work                   | Complete |
| Create unit tests for RadioGroup component    | Tests verify component renders correctly with all prop variations and option selection works               | Complete |
| Set up a11y tests for all form components     | All components pass accessibility tests with no violations                                                 | Complete |
| Create a form story displaying all components | Story shows all components with their variants in Storybook                                                | Complete |

## Implementation Notes

- Unit tests will follow the pattern established in the existing TextInput and Button tests
- a11y tests will use the Storybook addon-a11y
- The form story will showcase all components with their various states (default, disabled, with error, etc.)
