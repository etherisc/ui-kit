## Technical Requirements

### Implementation Standards

- All components must follow existing shadcn patterns
- Use Radix UI primitives where applicable
- Maintain consistent TypeScript typing
- Include comprehensive Storybook stories
- Include unit tests with React Testing Library
- Support both light and dark themes
- Include proper accessibility attributes

### Dependencies to Add

- `@radix-ui/react-accordion`
- `@radix-ui/react-alert-dialog`
- `@radix-ui/react-aspect-ratio`
- `@radix-ui/react-collapsible`
- `@radix-ui/react-context-menu`
- `@radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu`
- `@radix-ui/react-hover-card`
- `@radix-ui/react-menubar`
- `@radix-ui/react-navigation-menu`
- `@radix-ui/react-progress`
- `@radix-ui/react-scroll-area`
- `@radix-ui/react-separator`
- `@radix-ui/react-switch`
- `@radix-ui/react-tabs`
- `@radix-ui/react-toggle`
- `@radix-ui/react-toggle-group`
- `@radix-ui/react-tooltip`
- `embla-carousel-react` (for Carousel)
- `sonner` (for enhanced toasts)
- `input-otp` (for OTP input)

## Success Criteria

1. **Completeness**: All listed components implemented and functional
2. **Consistency**: Components follow existing design system patterns
3. **Quality**: All components have stories, tests, and documentation
4. **Integration**: Components work seamlessly together
5. **Performance**: Bundle size increase is reasonable (< 50% increase)
6. **Accessibility**: All components meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards
7. **TypeScript**: Full type safety with proper declarations

## Risks & Mitigations

- **Bundle Size**: Monitor bundle size impact, implement tree-shaking
- **Dependency Conflicts**: Test all Radix dependencies for compatibility
- **Breaking Changes**: Ensure no existing component APIs are modified
- **Performance**: Performance test with large component trees

## Timeline Estimate

- **Phase 1-2**: 2-3 days (Core components)
- **Phase 3-4**: 2-3 days (Form & layout enhancement)
- **Phase 5-6**: 3-4 days (Navigation & data display)
- **Phase 7-8**: 3-4 days (Advanced components)
- **Phase 9**: 1-2 days (Testing & documentation)

**Total Estimated Time**: 11-16 days

## Notes

- Focus on most commonly used components first (Card, Badge, Alert, etc.)
- Ensure each component integrates well with existing React Hook Form setup
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing components
- Consider creating compound components where appropriate (e.g., Card.Header, Card.Content)
