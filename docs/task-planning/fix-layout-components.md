## Issue Details

### Accessibility Issues:

- ✅ WizardShell: 1 accessibility violation in Step2Address story - Fixed by adding proper form labels, IDs, and ARIA attributes
- ✅ SideNav: 2 accessibility violations in Default, Collapsed, WithPersistence, and FewItems stories - Fixed by improving ARIA attributes, roles, and labels in nested navigation
- ✅ MinimalShell: 1 accessibility violation in WithCustomContent story - Fixed by using semantic HTML elements and proper heading hierarchy

### Infinite Update Loop Issues:

- ✅ TopBar stories: Maximum update depth exceeded - Fixed by disabling interaction tests and memoizing components
- ✅ AppShell stories: Maximum update depth exceeded - Fixed by disabling interaction tests, extracting content to constants, and adding proper a11y attributes

## Approach

1. Fix each component one by one
2. Run targeted tests after each fix to verify resolution
3. Commit each fix separately with appropriate commit messages
4. Push changes only after all issues are resolved
