# Task 2.1 Planning: Form Components

## Overview

This task involves implementing four form-related components:

- NumberInput
- Select
- Checkbox
- RadioGroup

These components will follow the established design patterns in the existing codebase, utilizing Shadcn UI as the foundation and conforming to the accessibility requirements.

## Task Breakdown

| Task Description                              | Definition of Done (DoD)                                                                                            | Status |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| Set up directory structure for each component | All four component directories created with appropriate files (component, types, tests, stories)                    | open   |
| Implement NumberInput component               | Component renders correctly and accepts all required props; Unit tests pass; a11y tests pass                        | open   |
| Implement Select component                    | Component renders correctly and accepts all required props; Unit tests pass; a11y tests pass                        | open   |
| Implement Checkbox component                  | Component renders correctly and accepts all required props; Unit tests pass; a11y tests pass                        | open   |
| Implement RadioGroup component                | Component renders correctly and accepts all required props; Unit tests pass; a11y tests pass                        | open   |
| Update barrel exports in index.ts             | All components are properly exported and accessible from the package's public API                                   | open   |
| Create consolidated form story                | Story shows all components working together in a cohesive form; All components render correctly with proper styling | open   |
| Final review and documentation                | All components are properly documented; Code adheres to project standards; No lint errors; All tests pass           | open   |

## Implementation Strategy

### Component Architecture

- Each component will be implemented following the same pattern as existing components (Button, TextInput)
- Components will be built on top of Shadcn UI primitives
- Each component will have proper TypeScript typing
- Components will include accessibility features

### Testing Approach

- Unit tests with Vitest for functionality
- Accessibility tests with axe-core
- Storybook stories to demonstrate all variants and states
- Snapshot tests for visual regression

## Timeline

- Estimated completion: 3-4 days
- First 2 days: Implement individual components
- Last 1-2 days: Integration, testing, and documentation
