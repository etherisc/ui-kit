# Task 3.1 - DataTable Component with TanStack Table

## Overview

This task involves implementing a DataTable component that wraps TanStack Table v8 with pagination and resize functionality. The component will be reusable across the application and will serve as the foundation for displaying tabular data.

## Objectives

- Create a DataTable component that wraps TanStack Table v8
- Implement pagination functionality
- Add column resize capabilities
- Create a Storybook story with 50 rows to demonstrate pagination
- Write Playwright tests to verify pagination functionality

## Requirements

1. The DataTable component should:

   - Accept data as an array of objects
   - Allow configuration of columns (width, header, accessor)
   - Support client-side pagination
   - Support column resizing
   - Be fully accessible (keyboard navigation, screen reader support)
   - Support sorting (optional)
   - Support filtering (optional)

2. The component should integrate with the existing UI Kit design system:
   - Use existing Button components for pagination controls
   - Match the design language of the UI Kit
   - Support both light and dark themes

## Implementation Plan

1. **Research and Setup**:

   - Research TanStack Table v8 API and best practices
   - Install required dependencies
   - Set up basic component structure

2. **Core Functionality**:

   - Implement basic table rendering
   - Add column configuration options
   - Implement pagination hooks and UI
   - Add column resize functionality

3. **Testing and Documentation**:
   - Create comprehensive Storybook stories
   - Write Playwright tests for pagination
   - Ensure accessibility compliance
   - Document the component API and usage examples

## Technical Considerations

- TanStack Table v8 is headless, so we'll need to implement all UI elements. UI elements should be created using shadcn CLI and then wrapped in wrapper components; check styling_rules.mdc for details.
- Pagination can be implemented using TanStack's built-in pagination hooks
- Column resizing will require some custom CSS and event handling
- We'll need to ensure the table is accessible to keyboard and screen reader users
