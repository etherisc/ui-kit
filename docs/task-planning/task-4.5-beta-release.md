- [x] Documentation is comprehensive and clear

## Testing

### Local Testing

- ✅ Package builds successfully
- ✅ Bundle size within limits (144.63 KB gzipped)
- ✅ Storybook builds and includes all components
- ✅ Release script validates environment

### CI/CD Testing

- ⏳ Workflow can be triggered manually
- ⏳ Package publishes to GitHub Packages
- ⏳ Storybook deploys to GitHub Pages
- ⏳ GitHub Release created with proper notes

## Next Steps

1. **Create the actual release**:

   ```bash
   git tag v0.1.0-beta
   git push origin v0.1.0-beta
   ```

2. **Monitor the release workflow**:

   - Watch GitHub Actions workflow complete
   - Verify package publication
   - Check Storybook deployment
   - Confirm GitHub Release creation

3. **Post-release verification**:
   ```bash
   npm info @org/ui-kit@0.1.0-beta
   ```
   - Visit: https://etherisc.github.io/ui-kit/
   - Check `window.BUILD_INFO` in browser console

## Dependencies
