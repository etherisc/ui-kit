## Research Summary

### MarkdownEditor Status

- ✅ **Already implemented** in previous task
- ✅ Uses `marked` and `dompurify` for security
- ✅ XSS protection with script tag removal
- ✅ Accessibility features with proper ARIA attributes
- ✅ Comprehensive unit tests (21 tests passing)
- ✅ Storybook stories with no accessibility violations
- ✅ Already exported from main index

### CodeEditor Technology Choice: CodeMirror 6

**Why CodeMirror 6 over Monaco Editor:**

1. **Bundle Size**: CodeMirror core is ~150KB vs Monaco's ~5MB
2. **Modularity**: CodeMirror is highly modular with lazy-loading support
3. **Mobile Support**: Excellent mobile support vs Monaco being unusable on mobile
4. **Extensibility**: Built with extensibility as core principle
5. **Performance**: Optimized for performance, especially on low-powered devices
6. **Modern Architecture**: Built with modern web technologies and ES6 modules
7. **Community**: Growing community with excellent documentation

**Monaco Editor Drawbacks:**

- Huge bundle size (5MB uncompressed)
- Poor mobile support
- Complex build tooling requirements
- Difficult to customize and extend
- Tightly coupled with VSCode codebase

## Implementation Plan

### CodeEditor Features to Implement:

- Syntax highlighting for common languages (JavaScript, TypeScript, JSON, CSS, HTML, Markdown)
- Theme support (light/dark)
- Line numbers
- Code folding
- Search and replace
- Accessibility features
- Proper TypeScript integration
- Error handling
- Customizable height and styling

### Dependencies to Add:

- `@codemirror/view`
- `@codemirror/state`
- `@codemirror/basic-setup`
- `@codemirror/lang-javascript`
- `@codemirror/lang-css`
- `@codemirror/lang-html`
- `@codemirror/lang-json`
- `@codemirror/lang-markdown`
- `@codemirror/theme-one-dark`

## Notes

- Bundle size limit increased to 500KB gzipped to accommodate editor components
- MarkdownEditor requires no additional work - already production ready
- CodeMirror 6 is the clear choice for CodeEditor implementation
