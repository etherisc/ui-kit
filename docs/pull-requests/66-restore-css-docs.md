# Restore Comprehensive CSS Architecture Documentation

## Overview

This PR restores the comprehensive CSS architecture documentation that was accidentally removed in a previous commit. The documentation is crucial for maintaining consistency and understanding of our CSS architecture.

## Changes

### Documentation Restoration

- Restored `css-architecture.md` with detailed documentation about:
  - Three-layer CSS architecture
  - File structure and responsibilities
  - CSS cascade flow
  - Variable naming strategy
  - Conflict prevention rules
  - Testing strategy
  - Common pitfalls and solutions
  - Debugging techniques
  - Maintenance checklist

### CSS File Updates

- Restored comment blocks in:
  - `theme.css`: Documentation of its role as the dynamic bridge between DaisyUI and Shadcn
  - `globals.css`: Documentation of its role as the foundation and safety net

## Technical Details

### CSS Architecture Layers

1. **Foundation Layer** (`globals.css`)

   - Sets up Tailwind CSS
   - Defines static fallback values
   - Establishes base CSS variables

2. **Theme Layer** (`theme.css`)

   - Maps DaisyUI variables to Shadcn names
   - Handles light/dark mode switching
   - Provides dynamic theme values

3. **Component Layer**
   - Uses variables from both layers
   - Implements component-specific styles
   - Maintains consistent theming

### Variable Naming Strategy

- Clear hierarchy in variable names
- Consistent prefixing for different types
- Proper fallback values for each variable

## Impact

This restoration ensures:

- Clear understanding of our CSS architecture
- Consistent variable naming and usage
- Proper documentation of the three-layer system
- Better maintainability for future developers
