# Agent Instructions â€“ Documentation

This directory stores the planning and setup documents for the UI Kit. When you
add or modify functionality in the project, update the relevant markdown files in
this folder as part of your pull request.

## Guidelines
- Keep documentation in Markdown with a clear structure and 80 character line
  width (see `.editorconfig`).
- Reflect any architectural or workflow changes in `planning.md` and
  `project_plan.md`.
- `setup.md` describes how to bootstrap the repository. Extend it only when the
  initial setup process changes.
- The design token reference lives in `packages/ui-kit/src/theme/TOKENS.md`; when
  tokens change, document them here as described in Sprint 1.5.
- Use the same Conventional Commit style for documentation updates (`docs:`
  prefix).
