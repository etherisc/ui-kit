# DataTable Pagination Layout Fix

## 🎯 Objective

Fix the DataTable pagination layout to ensure proper responsive behavior and alignment across all screen sizes.

## 🔍 Problem

The pagination elements were vertically stacked on all screen sizes, making it difficult to use on desktop. Additionally, the alignment of elements wasn't optimal for different viewport widths.

## 🛠️ Solution

Implemented a responsive layout with proper breakpoints and alignment:

### Mobile Layout (default)

- Elements stack vertically for better usability on small screens
- Each section (page size selector, navigation, info) takes full width
- Proper spacing between sections

### Desktop Layout (sm breakpoint and above)

- Elements arranged horizontally
- Page size selector left-aligned
- Navigation controls and info right-aligned
- Proper spacing between sections

## 📝 Changes

1. **DataTablePagination.tsx**

   - Added responsive flex layout with breakpoints
   - Improved container structure for better alignment
   - Added proper spacing classes

2. **Pagination.tsx**
   - Enhanced PaginationContent component with better alignment
   - Added justify-center for consistent centering

## 🧪 Testing

- Verified layout on multiple viewport sizes:
  - Mobile (< 640px)
  - Tablet (640px - 1024px)
  - Desktop (> 1024px)
- All tests passing (1041 tests)
- Build successful
- No linting errors (only fast refresh warnings)

## 📸 Screenshots

Please test the changes on different screen sizes to verify the layout improvements.

## 🔄 Migration

No migration needed. This is a layout-only change that doesn't affect the component's API or behavior.

## 📚 Documentation

The changes maintain the existing documentation as they only affect the visual presentation of the pagination controls.
