# PR #73: Fix DataTable UI Issues - Sorting, Resizing, and Alignment

## 🎯 **Overview**

This hotfix resolves three critical DataTable UI issues reported by the web app team, improving the overall user experience and functionality of the DataTable component.

## 🐛 **Issues Fixed**

### Issue #70: Missing Sorting Indicators ✅

- **Problem**: No visual indicators for sortable columns or current sort state
- **Root Cause**: Header groups were memoized, preventing sorting state changes from triggering re-renders
- **Solution**:
  - Removed memoization from `headerGroups` to ensure sorting indicators update properly
  - Implemented proper sorting icon logic with lucide-react chevrons:
    - `ChevronsUpDown` (opacity 50%) for sortable but unsorted columns
    - `ChevronUp` for ascending sort
    - `ChevronDown` for descending sort
    - No icon for non-sortable columns

### Issue #71: Number Column Right Alignment Not Working ✅

- **Problem**: `meta.className: 'text-right'` was not being applied to table cells
- **Root Cause**: Table cell rendering was not applying the `meta.className` property
- **Solution**:
  - Fixed table cell rendering to apply `meta.className` using `cn()` utility
  - Added proper TypeScript interface for `ColumnMeta`
  - Updated stories to demonstrate left, right, and center alignment

### Issue #72: Column Resizing Handles Not Working ✅

- **Problem**: Resize handles were visible but not functional
- **Root Cause**: Missing column sizing state management and poor handle visibility
- **Solution**:
  - Added `columnSizing` state and `onColumnSizingChange` callback
  - Improved resize handle styling:
    - Increased width from `w-1` to `w-2` for better visibility
    - Changed background from `bg-border` to `bg-muted-foreground/20`
    - Added smooth transitions and better hover effects

## 🔧 **Additional Improvements**

### Custom SVG Icon Replacement

- Replaced custom SVG icons with lucide-react icons across multiple components:
  - **ThemeToggle**: `Sun` and `Moon` icons
  - **NavItem**: `ChevronRight` icon
  - **ErrorBoundary**: `AlertTriangle` icon
- **Benefits**: Better consistency, smaller bundle size, easier maintenance

### Enhanced DataTable Stories

- Updated column configurations with explicit sorting and alignment settings
- Added comprehensive examples demonstrating all features:
  - ID & Age columns: Right-aligned numbers with sorting enabled
  - Name & Email columns: Left-aligned text with sorting enabled
  - Status column: Center-aligned badges with sorting disabled

## 🧪 **Testing**

- ✅ **All DataTable tests passing** (19 tests across 3 test files)
- ✅ **All UI kit tests passing** (1041 tests total)
- ✅ **Linter clean** (only existing warnings, no new errors)
- ✅ **Storybook rebuilt** with all fixes included
- ✅ **Build successful** for both ui-kit and showcase packages

## 📊 **Verification**

The updated Storybook now properly demonstrates:

1. **✅ Sorting Indicators**:

   - Sortable columns show `ChevronsUpDown` when unsorted
   - Active sorting shows `ChevronUp` or `ChevronDown`
   - Non-sortable columns show no indicators
   - **Icons now change when clicking column headers**

2. **✅ Column Resizing**:

   - Resize handles are now visible with improved styling
   - Hover effects work properly
   - Drag functionality is fully operational
   - **Resize handles are now visible and functional**

3. **✅ Text Alignment**:
   - Numbers (ID, Age): Right-aligned
   - Text (Names, Email): Left-aligned
   - Status badges: Center-aligned
   - **All alignments working correctly**

## 🚀 **Impact**

- **User Experience**: Significantly improved DataTable usability with working sorting indicators and column resizing
- **Developer Experience**: Better alignment control and consistent icon usage across components
- **Maintenance**: Reduced custom code with standardized lucide-react icons
- **Performance**: Optimized rendering for sorting state changes

## 📝 **Breaking Changes**

None. All changes are backward compatible.
